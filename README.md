Bitmatica Web App Boilerplate
=============================

Over the years, the [Bitmatica](http://www.bitmatica.com/) team has tried many technologies and we've gradually assembled a "best practice" contemporary web app stack that we believe is stable, powerful, and production-ready.

This project provides an example of these chosen technologies wired up and working together.

With a few customizations, this could serve as great initial commit for your next web app.
